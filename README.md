# Speedcode Generator Generator for mortals

The aim or this project is to create a tool that aids the process of writing [speedcode](http://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:speedcode) generators for the MOS 6502 processor family. Most of us do prototypes using macros in assemblers or generate code by other programs (or both), but that's not production ready code. The [real thing](http://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:speedcode#runtime_code_generators) is to generate the same code in memory with machine code. This can be a very boring or sometimes very complex task especially if the code is highly optimized.

The basic idea is that two PRG files (binary files), one for the speedcode and one that contains a list of typical code snippets should be enough to parse the speedcode, extract data and generate a speedcode generator that can reconstruct the exact same speedcode based on that data. Different parts of the data can be directed into different streams and those streams can be replaced by generators if needed, like consecutive write addresses doesn't have to be stored as data.
